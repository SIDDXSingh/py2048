## Welcome to 2048 Game Coded Via python


I have created a simple 2048 game using python.
This Game is designed in windows platform but can run in both windows and linux.
The Movement is controlled by the following keywords:
  * w: for upper movement
  * a: for left movement
  * s: for downward movement
  * d: for right movement
 
The Game Algorithm consists of simple shiting and addition of list elements.

Some screenshots of the game:
